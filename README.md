# What's this?

This is an attempt to wrap `shepardjs` for use with Blazor. Unfortunately, the buttons actions require a JS function with can't be passed down from C# to JS without converting the string to a function.

I didn't want to lose what I had so I've backed it up here. It might work in the future or with additional effort.
